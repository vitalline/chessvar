2024 Chess with Different Armies thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/chessvariants/comments/190l46o/2024_chess_with_different_armies_thread/

NB: The information presented here was partially reorganized, and edited to reflect the implementation used, for the reader's convenience.

This variant, specifically with the 4 original armies, the Fabulous FIDEs (regular army) and 3 new ones, was created by Ralph Betza and is one of the more well known ones.
Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_with_different_armies
Chess Variant page: https://www.chessvariants.org/unequal.dir/cwda.html

At the start of the game, each player picks one of the armies listed below to play with. Players may select the armies in any way they like, be it randomly, by agreement, or independently. The pawns and kings always stay the same. Other pieces are replaced with the corresponding pieces of the given army. The king is still the royal piece - checkmate the enemy king to win.

R - Castle (Rook position, some armies have each one being unique and opposite in some manner)
N - Median (Knight position)
B - Flank (Bishop position)
Q - Consort (Queen position)

A lot (but not all) of the armies have one or more colorbound piece types. Such pieces can only move to squares of one color (black or white), the same color as the one they started on. Buzzing Busters (see below) also have pieces that are filebound, meaning they can only move to certain files (namely, files that are colored the same as the one such a piece started on). However, there are no armies where all of the new pieces have such movement restrictions. Notably, none of the consorts do.

Castling works as normal, with one exception when castling queenside: if the piece replacing the rook is colorbound or filebound, the king moves three squares and the piece moves two. This is so that the rook-replacing piece does not change which colors or files it can move to. Kingside castling also works as normal, even if castling with a colorbound/filebound piece.

Pawns promote as normal, but can only be promoted to pieces that were on the board at the start of the game (owned by either player), excluding pawns and kings.

NB: The notation used for the pieces is an extension of XBetza (itself an extension of Betza notation) as defined here: https://www.chessvariants.com/page/MSbetza-notation-extended
The additional extension is used to notate some of the more complicated movement conditions, such as halfling pieces (hh*), automatic capture in a certain range (cc*), movement that depends on board half (*l,*r), square color (*w,*b), whether the square color matches the side (*s,*d), and movement that is randomly chosen between multiple options ({*,*,...}), where * represents arbitrary movement notation. In addition, the notation used for some of the pieces may change later, likely to something more readable (but nonetheless valid).

Component pieces: These do not appear by themselves here but do appear as components for the compound pieces.

Ferz (F): 1 space diagonally
Alfil (A): Leaps exactly 2 spaces diagonally, also known as an elephant but not the only one (the Xiangqi elephant is the lame, or non-leaping, version of this)
Guard/Man/Commoner (K): 1 space radially, what a king is a royal instance of
Wazir (W): 1 space orthogonally
Dabbaba (D): Leaps exactly 2 spaces orthogonally
Alibaba (AD): Leaps exactly 2 spaces radially, alfil/dabbaba compound
Dede (DD): Like a rook but leaps over all differently-colored spaces, i.e. a dabbaba-rider (I named it after its Betza notation)
Mahavat (AA): Diagonal equivalent to a dede (I named it after a synonym to the Hindi word for "mahout")
Mahadede (AADD): Dede/mahavat compound (I used maha- in the context of being the Indian "mega")
Trebuchet (H): Leaps exactly 3 spaces orthogonally
Tripper (G): Leaps exactly 3 spaces diagonally
Horse (afsW): Like a knight but can be blocked by an orthogonally adjacent piece (from Xiangqi but also in Janggi)
Bombard (pR): Like a rook but must leap over a piece of either side to make any movement (from Janggi)
Arbalest (pB): Diagonal equivalent to the bombard
Cannon (mRcpR): Moves passively as a rook but captures as an bombard (from Xiangqi)
Arrow (mBcpB): Moves passively as a bishop but captures as an arbalest
Point (fW): 1 space orthogonally forward
Cross (fF): 1 space diagonally forward
Gold general (WfF): Wazir/cross compound (from Shougi)
Silver general (FfW): Ferz/point compound (from Shougi)
Copper general (vWfF): Like a cross or vertical wazir (from some Shougi variants)
Platinum general (FfsW): Like a guard except directly backward (from Chuu Shougi, called suizou in the original Japanese)
Manticore (WyafsW): As a wazir and can then slide diagonally outward
Helm (fN): As a forward-most knight
Crab (ffbsN): As a forward-most or backward horizontal-most knight
Barc (fsbbN): As a backward-most or forward horizontal-most knight
Steward (mWcF): Moves passively as a wazir and captures as a ferz, like a pawn but in all 4 directions
Narrow [oblique piece]: Vertical-most
Wide [oblique piece]: Horizontal-most
Lame [leaper]: Slides through the intermediate squares instead of leaping over them (meaning it can be blocked)
Crooked [rider]: Changes direction in a zig-zag pattern along a certain path/direction

Far-leaper limit: Because some pieces can leap over 2 spaces away, they could easily threaten pieces on the back row, so it would be best to have it so that they can only move there if the back row is unobstructed, thus limiting their leaping.
NB: The far-leaper limit is currently not implemented. This may change in the future.

Original armies: The regular army is called the Fabulous FIDEs.

Colorbound Clobberers: Based on color-bound pieces, especially those that leap exactly 2 spaces
R - Bede (BD): As a bishop or leaps exactly 2 spaces orthogonally, i.e. a bishop/dabbaba compound

B - Fad (FAD): 1 space diagonally or leaps exactly 2 spaces either diagonally or orthogonally, i.e. a ferz/alibaba compound respectively
Q - Archbishop (BN): Bishop/knight compound

Remarkable Rookies: Based on rooks
R - Fork (R4): Up to 4 spaces as a rook (originally called a short rook)
N - Woodrook (WD): Up to 2 spaces orthogonally including leaping, i.e. a wazir/dabbaba compound (originally called a woody rook)

Some preexisting ideas that need no alteration: Excluding the Cruel Crooks (see below)

Cylindrical Cinders: Based on cylindrical chess variants, the following treat the board as a cylinder with the edge files being connected and thus with each rank being boundless
R - Waffle (oWoA): 1 space orthogonally or leaps exactly 2 spaces diagonally, i.e. a wazir/alfil compound; has the cylinder property
N - Knight (oN): As usual except for the cylinder property
B - Bishop (oB): As usual except for the cylinder property
Q - Chancellor (oRoN): Rook/knight compound; has the cylinder property

B - Falcon (FAA): Diagonal equivalent to the wader, ferz/mahavat compound
Q - Kingfisher (KAADD): Wader/falcon compound, so a guard/mahadede compound

Claustrophobic Cannoneers: My name-theme-consistent name for the Spacious Cannoneers, the following pieces generally have both cannon/bombard-based and spacious (not being able to stop next to another piece) movements, hence the original name, along their FIDE equivalent lines
R (starting on dark) - Mortar (WssRcpR): Like a wazir, spacious rook, or a cannon, as in being able to leap over one piece and capture an enemy along the same line
R (starting on light) - Howitzer (WssRmpR): Like a mortar but makes a passive bombard leap instead of a cannon leap, i.e. slides passively beyond the piece leapt over
N - Napoleon (fbNW): Like a wazir or narrow knight, the wazir equivalent of the fibnif
B - Carronade (ssBpB): Like a spacious bishop or an arbalest (can leap over a piece on the same line to move or capture beyond like a bishop)

Pizza Pounders: My name-theme-consistent name for the Pizza Kings, with short-ranged movesets that resemble various pizza toppings

N - Mushroom (vNfsCbF): Like a narrow knight, backward ferz, or forward wide camel (3,1 leaper)
B - Sausage (sWFvNvH): Like a ferz, horizontal wazir, narrow knight, or vertical trebuchet, and its moveset resembles an oblong object, such as a sausage, hence the name (for the latter to not highly shorten gameplay, the trebuchet movements could be lame, which fits the piece's theme even more)
Q - Meatball (FWADfN): Like a guard, alibaba (AD, alfil/dabbaba compound), or helm, the moveset sort of resembles a dripping meatball

Demirifle Destroyers: The following pieces will automatically capture any enemy on a space they can move to (when facing each other, the piece that just moved/promoted captures first)

N - Crab (mccffbsN): As a forward-most knight or backward wide knight
B - Lobster (mccfAmccbF): As a forward alfil or backward ferz
Q - Crabsnail (mccWmccfDmccffbsN): Snail/crab compound

Altered preexisting concepts: Either one piece in the original idea is already in another army or the substituted piece type is too weak or strong

R - Ivory Rook (vRsWsD): As a vertical rook or horizontal woodrook
N - Knishop (fhNbB): As a backward bishop or a forward knight
B - Bishight (fBbhN): As a forward bishop or a backward knight, rank-inverse of the knishop

Pawnshop Praetorians: Based on pawns and similar pieces, divergent movements and all while also being based mostly on knight/pawn compounds

Contrarian Crashers: These are based on divergent pieces (like pawns) and their captures are all that prevents them from being color-bound
R - Merlion (ADcK): Murray Lion, moves like an alibaba but can also capture as a guard (this piece originated from a mistranslation of the movement of the lion from Chuu Shougi, but the name I came up with is a reference to a Singaporean national symbol)

R (right) - Left Que (sRflbrB): Like a horizontal rook or a forward-left and back-right bishop
N - Knish (lBrhNl,rBlhNr): On the left side of the board, a knight on right and a bishop on left, and on the right side of the board, the other way around
B - Blizzard (FflbrBfrrfbllbCl,FfrblBfllfbrrbCr): On the left side of the board, a bishop forward-left or backward-right and otherwise away from those lines as a wizard, and on the right side of the board, the other way around
Q - Chanqueen (RlBrhNl,RrBlhNr): Knish/rook compound

Colorful Characters: Each of these pieces moves differently depending on what color they're on while not being that much more or less powerful on either color
R (starting on dark) - Elkrider (NNw,Rb): If on dark, can move as a rook, but if on light, can move as a nightrider (for context, an elk (Nw,Rb) would be like this piece, but it can only go as a knight on light)
R (starting on light) - Caribourider (Rw,NNb): Space-color inverse of the elkrider (the knight-on-dark inverse of the elk (Rw,Nb) would be what I like to call a caribou)
N - Deuterocannon (mRcpRw,Nb): Like a knight on dark and a cannon on light
B - Nightlight (fBbhNw,FW[W-DD]b): As a forward bishop, backward knight on light, and a panda or ferz on dark
Q - Nanqueen (Qi,NNKo): As a queen on its starting color and a nanking on the other one, so it can move as a guard regardless

Probable Prowlers: These pieces have a 50/50% chance, generally by way of coin toss, of either moving as one piece or another, and are either 'fast' (longer ranged) or 'slow' (shorter ranged), and yes, I've watched VeggieTales
R - Veteran ({R,KAD}): Like a rook when fast and a guard/alibaba compound when slow
N - Redpanda ({W[W-DD],N}): Like a panda when fast and a knight when slow
B - Tempofad ({B,FAD}): Like a bishop when fast and a fad when slow
Q - Waterbuffalo ({Q,NCZ}): Like a queen when fast and like a buffalo when slow (created for the Water Buffalo Game, which inspired this army)
